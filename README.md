## TF2 Strange Weapon Information

This is a very simple program I made because I was too lazy to do the calculations every time I wanted to see how many strange part counts I have gotten per kill.

For example, If you have a scattergun with 10 kills and a strange part with a count of 100, you should have 10 strange counts per kill.
